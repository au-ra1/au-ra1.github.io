Here is my first blog post! Not much here right now, but I've set up my website; this time, I decided to not use a framework and just figure it out from scratch. It's only a small, static site anyway... I used TS for the blog logic, as well as the dark/light mode logic (you can check out the latter in the top right. ☼) For the displaying of the blog on one page, I dynamically loaded each post onto a specific page when it's called. The idea is to have a URL identifier generated for each blog post, and then it can be directly queried:

```typescript
 postsList.forEach(post => {
        const li = document.createElement("li");
        const link = document.createElement("a");
        link.href = `./currentBlog.html?post=${encodeURIComponent("/content/" + post.file)}`;
        link.textContent = `${post.title} - ${post.date}`;
        link.target = "";
        li.appendChild(link);
        postsListElements.appendChild(li);
    });
    
```
It's been pretty fun, although webdev...generally speaking: ugh. It was good to do it from scratch* and create a tsconfig.json, etc. 

*I did use [marked](https://marked.js.org/) for markdown parsing, and [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/) for syntax highlighting.

For the dark and light themes, I had two css presets for each theme: 

```css

[data-theme = "light"] {
    --color-bg: #e7e5ce; /*background colour var*/
	--color: rgb(107, 107, 107);  /*text colour var*/
	--color-nav: #e7e5ce; /*Navbar background colour var*/
    --color-border: #c6c7bd; /* border colour for centre box */
    
       }

[data-theme = "dark"] {
    --color-bg: #1f1f1f;
    --color: rgb(211, 211, 211);
    --color-nav: #1f1f1f;
    --color-border: #5a5a5a;

      }

```

I reused this for the highlight.js code styling as well - I saw some people made JS scripts that simply cut out the tags depending on which theme was used to disable them. I decided to instead do something marginally more simple; I copied both dark and light themes into a single css file, and simply wrapped the data-theme css class around each theme. Simple. 

Anyway, that's it for the first blog. The code is not great at all, but it works. More to come! I'll also populate my projects tab. But for now, goodbye.
