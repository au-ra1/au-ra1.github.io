Here is my first blog post! Not much here right now, but I've set up my website; this time, I decided to not use a framework and just figure it out from scratch. It's only a small, static site anyway... I used TS for the blog logic, as well as the dark/light mode logic (you can check out the latter in the top right. ☼) I still need to build the .md parser...which means that if you see this, I've built it. Currently it already parses the date/title, so I just need to sort out the maintext and images. Well, that's all for now. More to come...
