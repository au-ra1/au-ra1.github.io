Here is my first blog post! Not much here right now, but I've set up my website; this time, I decided to not use a framework and just figure it out from scratch. It's only a small, static site anyway... I used TS for the blog logic, as well as the dark/light mode logic (you can check out the latter in the top right. ☼) For the displaying of the blog on one page, I dynamically loaded each post onto a specific page when it's called. The idea is to have a URL identifier generated for each blog post, and then it can be directly queried:

``` function getQueryParam(param: string) {
    const urlParams = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search);
    return urlParams.get(param);
  }
  ``
